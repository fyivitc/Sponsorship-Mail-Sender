    <p>Greetings Sir / Ma'am,</p>
    <p><em>We hope this email finds you well.</em></p>

      This is Sakshi from <b>FYI, VIT Chennai</b>. Fraternity of Young
      Innovators (FYI) is a student-level initiative with over 500+ members and
      a reach of over 10,000, that seeks to facilitate change. FYI is planning
      to conduct a mini-fest in offline mode. This event will be the pre-show of
      <b>VIBRANCE</b> (The biggest cultural fest of VIT). It's going to be a
      3-day event that will be conducted from
      <b>February 17 to February 19, 2023</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first segment consists of music and dance performances (flash mob),
      followed by a crazy bike stunt show. The second segment is going to be a
      panel talk by influential speakers such as
      <b>Suhani Shah, Love Babbar, Ashneer Grover</b> (tentative). The third
      segment will be <b>Sunburn</b> or Under25 Experiences in collaboration
      with Under25 VITC. The event is anticipated to draw about 1000+ students.
